# ToDo List App

## Description

The ToDo List App is a simple yet powerful task management tool designed to help users organize their daily tasks efficiently. The application allows users to seamlessly add, edit, and mark tasks as completed. With an intuitive user interface and persistent data storage.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were employed in the development of the ToDo List App:

- React: A widely-used JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- CSS Modules: Utilized to encapsulate styles and prevent global CSS conflicts, enhancing the maintainability of the project's styling.
- Jest: A popular JavaScript testing framework for unit testing, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the application's functionalities.
- React Testing Library: Employed to create efficient and maintainable tests, improving the overall quality of the codebase.

## Project Purpose

The primary objective of the ToDo List App project is to facilitate the understanding and implementation of a reducer in React. By centralizing the state management logic within a single reducer function, the project aims to enhance code organization and separation of concerns. This practice encourages a cleaner architecture and supports maintainability as the application scales.

## Features

The ToDo List App offers the following features:

- **Task Management**: Users can seamlessly add tasks using the "Add" button, edit tasks using the "Edit" button, cancel edits with the "Cancel" button, or save changes with the "Save" button.
- **Task Completion**: Users can mark tasks as "done" by clicking on the checkbox associated with each task.
- **Task Count**: The application displays the total number of tasks and the count of pending tasks, providing users with an overview of their task list.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are persisted across page reloads using localStorage, ensuring that users don't lose their task data.
